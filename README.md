#Total Fusion

Dynamically updating customer-facing restaurant menu built with Backbone.js, Skeleton CSS framework, and Parse as a backend server.

I built this in week 7 at The Iron Yard Academy to practice planning, designing and creating a Backbone-based dynamic front end application based on client requirements.  The Skeleton CSS framework is used for it's button elements and lightweight responsive grid framework.
